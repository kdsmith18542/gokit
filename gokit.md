ALL CODE MUST BE PRODUCTION GRADE!!! NO STUBS!!


GoKit: A Unified Web Development Toolkit for Go
1. Project Vision & Goals
Mission
To provide a comprehensive, idiomatic, and robust set of libraries that remedy the most common challenges in Go web development. GoKit aims to drastically reduce boilerplate code, eliminate common errors, and streamline the implementation of form validation, internationalization (i18n), and advanced file handling.

Core Goals
Reduce Boilerplate: Abstract away repetitive tasks with a simple, declarative API.

Improve Security & Robustness: Provide sensible defaults and best practices for handling user input and files.

Be Modular & Composable: Allow developers to import and use only the components they need, ensuring the toolkit remains lightweight and unobtrusive.

High Performance: Design all components with performance in mind, striving for zero-allocation hot paths where possible.

Idiomatic Go: Adhere to Go conventions, including clear interface design, first-class error handling, and avoiding magic.

Non-Goals
Not a Framework: GoKit is a library, not a restrictive framework. It will not dictate application structure, routing, or middleware patterns. It is designed to augment the standard library and work with any existing router or framework.

Not a Standard Library Replacement: The goal is to build upon the powerful foundation of Go's net/http package, not replace it.

New: Cross-Cutting Concerns
Context-Awareness: All potentially long-running operations (validation with DB lookups, file uploads, etc.) will accept a context.Context to handle cancellations, deadlines, and timeouts gracefully.

Observability: Provide hooks for integration with standard telemetry libraries like OpenTelemetry. Spans and metrics will be emitted for key operations, allowing developers to monitor performance and trace requests through the toolkit's components.

2. Core Architecture
GoKit will be structured as a single Go module containing distinct, independent packages. This allows developers to import only the functionality they require, minimizing dependency bloat.

Root Module: github.com/kdsmith18542/gokit

Packages:

gokit/form: For validation and sanitization.

gokit/i18n: For internationalization and localization.

gokit/upload: For advanced file upload handling.

Each package will be self-contained and can be used independently of the others. The overall design will emphasize interfaces to ensure components are testable and extensible.

3. Module 1: form - Validation & Sanitization
This package provides a flexible and declarative way to validate and sanitize incoming data from various sources.

Core Features
Declarative Validation: Use struct tags for common validation rules (required, email, min, max, url, etc.).

Advanced Conditional Validation: Support for rules like required_if, gtfield, and ltfield for complex cross-field validation.

Custom & Asynchronous Validators: Easily register custom validation functions, including asynchronous ones (e.g., for a database uniqueness check) that respect context.Context.

Multiple Data Sources: Decode and validate from *http.Request, io.Reader (for JSON APIs), or raw map[string][]string.

Input Sanitization: Provide sanitizers (e.g., trim, escape_html, to_lower) that can be chained and applied via struct tags.

Detailed, User-Friendly Errors: Generate a map of validation errors (field -> []error_message) that can be easily serialized to JSON for API responses.

API Design Philosophy
The API will be centered around a form.Validator instance. The core function validator.DecodeAndValidate(ctx, source, &dest) will be flexible enough to handle different input sources. This separation of decoding and validation logic improves versatility.

Example Usage
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "github.com/kdsmith18542/gokit/form"
)

// Define a struct with advanced validation tags.
type SignUpForm struct {
    Email           string `form:"email" validate:"required,email"`
    Password        string `form:"password" validate:"required,min=8"`
    ConfirmPassword string `form:"confirm_password" validate:"required,eqfield=Password"`
    Bio             string `form:"bio" sanitize:"trim,escape_html"`
}

func SignUpHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    var s SignUpForm
    
    // Decode form data from the request and validate it against the struct.
    // The context is passed down for potential async validators.
    errs := form.DecodeAndValidate(r.Context(), r, &s)
    if errs != nil {
        // errs is a map[string][]string, perfect for a JSON response.
        http.Error(w, fmt.Sprintf("Validation errors: %v", errs), http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }

    // At this point, s is populated, sanitized, and validated.
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "Welcome, %s!", s.Email)
}

4. Module 2: i18n - Internationalization & Localization
This package provides a complete solution for managing translations and localizing content.

Core Features
Locale Detection: Automatic runtime locale detection from Accept-Language header, cookie, or query parameter, with a configurable fallback.

Message Bundles: Load translation messages from common formats (TOML, JSON, YAML) and from Go's embed filesystem.

Live Reloading: (Optional) In development mode, automatically reload message bundles when the source files change.

Pluralization: Full support for CLDR-based pluralization rules.

Web-based Editor: Advanced table-based UI for non-developers to edit translations directly in the browser, with features like live search, missing translation highlighting, and real-time save functionality.

Locale-Aware Formatting: Provide helpers for formatting numbers, currencies, and dates/times according to the detected locale.

Concurrency-Safe: The translation manager will be safe for concurrent use in HTTP handlers.

API Design Philosophy
An i18n.Manager will be initialized once at application startup. In handlers, a manager.Translator(r) method will return a request-scoped Translator instance that automatically uses the correct locale and provides translation and formatting methods.

Example Usage
package main

import (
    "embed"
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "time"
    "github.com/kdsmith18542/gokit/i18n"
)

//go:embed locales/*.toml
var localeFS embed.FS

var i18nManager *i18n.Manager

func init() {
    // Load all message files from the embedded filesystem.
    i18nManager = i18n.NewManagerFromFS(localeFS)
}

func GreetingHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    translator := i18nManager.Translator(r)

    // Translate a message with pluralization.
    itemCountMessage := translator.T("itemCount", map[string]interface{}{"Count": 5})

    // Format a date according to the user's locale.
    formattedDate := translator.FormatDate(time.Now())
    
    fmt.Fprintf(w, "%s\nLast login: %s", itemCountMessage, formattedDate)
}

5. Module 3: upload - Advanced File Handling
This package provides a high-level, secure API for processing file uploads, including large files and direct-to-cloud transfers.

Core Features
Streaming API: Process multipart form uploads without loading the entire file into memory.

Pluggable Storage Backends: Define a Storage interface with implementations for Local Disk, S3, GCS, Azure Blob, and an in-memory backend for testing.

Client-Side Upload Support: Generate pre-signed URLs for direct-to-cloud uploads from the client, reducing server load.

Validation: Enforce constraints on file size, MIME type, and checksums (MD5/SHA256).

Post-Processing Hooks: Register OnSuccess and OnError hooks to trigger subsequent actions like thumbnail generation or database updates.

Progress Tracking: Offer hooks or channels to monitor upload progress in real-time.

API Design Philosophy
An upload.Processor will be configured with storage and validation rules. It will expose a Process(ctx, r, fieldName) method to handle server-side uploads and a GenerateUploadURL(ctx, opts) method for client-side uploads.

Example Usage
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "net/http"
    "github.com/kdsmith18542/gokit/upload"
    "github.com/kdsmith18542/gokit/upload/storage"
)

var avatarUploader *upload.Processor

func init() {
    s3Storage, _ := storage.NewS3(/* config */)
    
    avatarUploader = upload.NewProcessor(s3Storage, upload.Options{
        MaxFileSize: 5 * 1024 * 1024, // 5 MB
        AllowedMIMETypes: []string{"image/jpeg", "image/png"},
    })
    
    // Register a hook to run after a successful upload.
    avatarUploader.OnSuccess(func(ctx context.Context, result upload.Result) {
        fmt.Printf("Triggering thumbnail generation for %s\n", result.URL)
        // queueThumbnailJob(ctx, result.URL)
    })
}

func UploadAvatarHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    results, err := avatarUploader.Process(r.Context(), r, "avatar")
    if err != nil {
        http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusBadRequest)
        return
    }

    for _, result := range results {
        fmt.Fprintf(w, "File %s uploaded to %s\n", result.OriginalName, result.URL)
    }
}

6. Project Roadmap
